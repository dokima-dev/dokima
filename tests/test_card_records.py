"""The issue and PR card shows the plan and its proof, drawn only from the agents' records and GitHub's checks.

Issue #180 (story 2 of #143). The card is drawn by `dokima/card.py` from what GitHub holds, never from the issue's text:

    card.render(repo, issue, found, page="issue")
        issue  {"number": 40, "url": ...}
        found  {"recs":       the agents' records, oldest first (dokima.agent.records),
                "pr":         the PR (GitHub's pulls API) or None,
                "check_runs": GitHub's check runs on the PR's latest commit,
                "reviews":    GitHub's reviews of the PR, oldest first,
                "owners":     the code owners' logins,
                "tests":      {"path::name": {"verified_by": first docstring line or None, "url": link to the test}},
                "worker":     the latest worker run or None}
    card.test_entry(repo, ref, path, source, name)   one entry of found["tests"], read from a test file's source
    card.gather(repo, number, pr_number)             fetches `found` from GitHub; main draws the card from it
        It reads GitHub only through `gh` (card.gh, or agent.gh / plan.gh when it reuses their helpers): the REST API
        (`gh api repos/...`, files through `contents/<path>?ref=<sha>`), `gh issue view`, `gh pr view`, `gh pr list`.
        The code owners are the ones named on the default branch, never on the PR's own commit.
    card.find_work(repo)                             the issue and its PR, asked of GitHub through card.gh

The plan is the newest planner record whose check passed. Criterion k is <issue>.k, the acceptance criteria first and
then the non-functional requirements, and its check is the check run named "<issue>.k · ...".

Layout, as the tests read it (issue #235): each criterion is one bullet line "- " opening with its verdict circle (an
<img> whose alt is its state, never inside a link), then its words, linked to its check when one exists; under it,
indented, one "Verified by" line per test with a docstring, where the words Verified by link to the test and the
docstring's first line follows. Markdown links and HTML links read alike. The non-functional requirements sit inside
a <details> fold. The Definition of Done is one line, the last with a circle
on the card: All tests, then review, then owner approval, each a circle (linked when there is a verdict) and its words.
Every circle's alt is one of: passed, failed, running, not started.
